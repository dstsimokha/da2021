Task 1
Database culture contains information about concert attendance in Europe:
    • country – country of the respondent,
    • concert1 – if the respondent attended concerts during last 12 month
    • edu – age when the respondent completed education
    • age – age in years
    • commun – type of community (rural area, small/middle town, large town)
    • bill – if the respondent has difficulties paying bills (no, yes)

Select only respondents from Estonia 
    1. Specify a model to predict concert attendance by age, gender, community type, difficulties paying bills and the age of education completion.
    2. Interpret the results.
    3. Check if age has a quadratic relationship with the probability of concert attendance.
    4. Visualize the effect of age, interpret the results.
    5. Look at model fit, interpret the results.

Task 2
Database values contains information about value orientations in Europe:
    • achiv – how much the respondent values achievement: personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards (scale from 1 to 6)
    • intgndr – gender of the interviewer
    • intage1 – age of the interviewer
    • gndr – gender of the respondent
    • age – age of the respondent
    • eduy – number of years of education
    • domicil – type of community 
    • cntry – country of the respondent 

Select only respondents from Finland
    1. Specify a model to predict the value of achievement by other variables.
    2. Interpret the results
    3. Check if there is an interaction effect between respondent’s age and respondent’s gender.
    4. Visualize the interaction effect, interpret the results.
    5. Look at model fit, interpret the results.
    6. Check if the model has outliers, multicollinearity, non-linear effects, and non-constant error variance.
